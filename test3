Objective
To build a secure, on-prem Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that consolidates fragmented vehicle-lending fulfillment knowledge—PDFs, Jira tickets, Confluence pages, databases and scanned documents—into a single, searchable source of truth, delivering fast, accurate answers while maintaining regulatory compliance and auditability.

Solution Overview

Apache NiFi (v2.0) – Orchestrates ingestion from files, OCR, APIs and databases.

Apache Tika (v2.3.9) – Extracts text from PDFs and Office docs in bulk.

Tesseract OCR (v5.3) – Converts scanned images into searchable text.

Sentence-Transformers (v4.1.0) – Embeds document chunks & user queries into semantic vectors.

Qdrant (v1.6.1) – High-performance on-prem vector database for approximate nearest-neighbor search.

LangChain (v2.0.0) – Assembles retrieved context and user prompts into LLM-ready payloads.

Llama 3 (v3.0 on-prem) – Generates concise answers guided by system, user & assistant roles.

Time & Cost Benefits

~25% faster resolution: Dramatically reduces time spent hunting for information across multiple systems.

SME load reduction: Fewer escalations to experts by surfacing precise, vetted answers.

Lower operational expense: On-prem tooling avoids recurring cloud-compute fees and data-egress costs.

Strategic Benefits

Consistent quality: Single source of truth eliminates conflicting guidance and manual errors.

Regulatory compliance: Full audit trail of every query, context chunk, and response for easy reporting.

Scalable foundation: Easily onboard new data sources—email archives, CRM systems, SharePoint—without rewriting code.

Summary Statements
By automating ingestion, semantic indexing and on-prem inference, this RAG Knowledge Assistant transforms days of manual research into instant, context-aware answers. It not only accelerates business workflows and reduces support costs but also fortifies your compliance posture with end-to-end traceability.
